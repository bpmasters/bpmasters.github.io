These are some speakers I built through the Acoustical Society of America and Audio Engineering Society student chapters at Purdue University. 


## White Speakers

The white speakers contain components from GR Research, I believe the AV1+ kit, although I'm not entirely sure. The enclosures were CNC routed in MDF. These speakers were built by myself during the annual speaker building workshop, during my first year at Purdue. This process included gluing, prepping, and finishing the cabinets, soldering crossovers, and final assembly. Thanks to grant funding, these only cost $50 per pair for each student, and were built over a 3-day workshop. I'd have to say that they'd be a pretty good value (sound-wise) for 10x that price, although I could have done a better job at the finishing.

## Blue Speakers

A few years later, in my final year at Purdue, I helped to host the workshop which I enjoyed so much before. My role in this was to coordinate the grant, receipt of payments from students, and to coordinate the purchase orders for the kits used. Additionally, I helped host the workshop. The kits used here were the C-Sharp Powered Speakers, which are smaller in size and contain an amplifier in one of the speakers. The process was similar to the white speakers otherwise.

Due to some absences during the workshop, I was able to take home one of the extra kits, and built it in my neighbors garage. In addition to the rest of the assembly process, I also modified the enclosure and electronics by including a pass-through to power the speakers with my own amp, if desired.
