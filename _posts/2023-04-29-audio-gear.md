The audio gear I have and use on a daily basis.

# Headphones

My interest in audio equipment started with headphones, so naturally I have a few pairs.

## Daily Driver
My daily driver is the Sennheiser HD 598, I've had these for probably 7-8 years at this point and use them daily because they are by far the most comfortable headphone I've ever worn. I've had to replace the earpads and headband once, but they live on. It's also nice that they're easy to drive, as based on my desk setup at the time, I may or may not have a dedicated headphone amp, but I always have an interface on my desk which easily powers these.

## Wireless
I collected a couple pairs of wireless ANC headphones during my stint at Bose. I have a pair of QC35 ii's and a pair of QC45's. These were my first ever experience with ANC and it's pretty remarkable. They sound pretty good to me too, especially in the low-end, as I typically wear open-backs which fall off hard at low frequencies.

## Others
I also have a pair of the Massdrop/Sennheiser HD 6XX's, which I wear when I'm having dedicated listening time, or when I have my headphone amp set up on my desk. I'm personally really fond of the Sennheiser sound that some call a veil, and as such these sound phenomenal to me.

Finally, I have a pair of Master & Dynamic MH40, which are very nicely designed and pretty good sounding closed-back headphones, although I find them heavy and slightly uncomfortable.

## Speakers
I have a portfolio post that details two sets of speakers, that I built. One of these is the C-Sharp kit from PartsExpress, the other is a transducer kit from GR Research, with custom cabs and crossovers. 

I also have a pair of Edifier R2000db that sit on my desk when I have enough space. These sound pretty great in a small room and the connectivity and ease of use, due to them being active, is really what makes me fond of them.

I also have a Bose SoundLink Flex I got for free on the first day of my internship there, which sounds really good and makes a nice water resistant portable speaker.

# Amplifiers

## Speaker Amps
My primary speaker, and for a long time headphone, amp was a Teac AI-101DA. This is really a brilliantly designed device, and sounds amazing, although it came with a hefty price tag. I've been using this for probably close to 6-7 years, and have had to replace the volume pot, as it was defective and would change volume on it's own.

Before repairing the Teac, but after it broke, I bought an SMSL SA300. I'm not very fond of it, as the IR sensor went out after only like a year or so. It sounded alright, and the bluetooth worked well at range as it had a nice antenna, but I wouldn't reccomend it. It was, however, small and therefore good for carrying over to my neighbor's house and putting in the closet when we would set up the whole home speaker system for parties.

## Headphone Amp
I have a Schiit Magni 3 Heresy. It sucks. It sounded fine when I got it, but the pots quickly corroded. That's no big deal, I sprayed some contact cleaner in and worked the static out. However, when set to high gain, there is a constant hum in the right channel, so I rarely have it set up anymore, especially since upgrading my interface.

# Audio Interface
I use a Universal Audio Volt 276. I really like the compressor, despite thinking I would never use it when I bought it, and I never need more than 2 inputs or outputs. It also looks very nice on my desk with the wood siding and I love the top facing knobs.

# Microphones
As ashamed as I am to admit it, I was using a webcam mic for a long time, and still frequently do. More recently, I needed two microphones for some work I was doing as part of my thesis, so I picked up a matched pair of monoprice pencil condenser mics. They don't sound great, but they do the job. I have them set up in a stereo configuration mounted above my monitor currently. I also have a measurement mic that I was using for some room correction projects at Purdue.

# Guitars
I have two guitars currently, they're both frankenstrats. I started with a '99 Mexican Strat in Midnight Blue. This was a really nice guitar, but I'm a tinkerer and like to change things, so I put new pickups in it, changed the pickguard, and eventually fit a new neck on it. I then took the old Fender neck and put it on the guitar I built in the guitar building course at Purdue, because the kit neck was absolutely terrible despite my best efforts to level and recrown the frets and set it up otherwise. So now I have two franken strats, one with Texas Special SSS pickups, and the other with some Seymour Duncan Humbuckers. They are both a dream to play and sound quite good.
