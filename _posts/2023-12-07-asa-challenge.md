# Challenge Problem and Approach

In this challenge, we applied spectral analysis and acoustic direction of arrival methods to characterize a divers motion as they pass over a transducer array consisting of 3 hydrophones. By utilizing frame-based energy analysis and cross-correlation based time of arrival differences, we were able to extract a geometric model of the divers motion over time, providing information about the diver's breathing rate, swim-speed, altitude, and time of closest approach. From this information we were able to produce a mathematical model of the diver's motion over time to validate our results. A manuscript detailing our solutions is attached below. See the original problem statement [here](https://acousticstoday.org/international-student-challenge-problem-in-acoustic-signal-processing-2023-brian-g-ferguson-r-lee-culver-and-kay-l-gemba/).
