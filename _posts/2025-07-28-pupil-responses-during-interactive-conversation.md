This study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine the time-course of pupil responses at fine temporal scales during conversation. We derive pupillary temporal response functions to different turn-taking and examine how these responses vary based on expected conversational difficulty. Inferences and interpretations relating these assessments to attention and effort are made.
