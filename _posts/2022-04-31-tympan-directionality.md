Experimental testing of directionality characteristics of an open-source hearing aid.

This was part of my undergraduate research at Purdue University. I was working in the Experimental Amplification Research (EAR) Lab with Dr. Joshua Alexander. We conducted this study as part of a design challenge for the Tympan, an open source hearing aid platform, and it was present at the 181st meeting of the Acoustical Society of America by Chip Audette of Creare. More details are included in the following [blog post on the Tympan forum](https://shop.tympan.org/pages/directionality-characteristics-of-the-tympan).
