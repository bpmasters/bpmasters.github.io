This solid body guitar was designed for a course in stringed instrument design.

#### Project Description

It's actually really simple! Add the rating in your YAML front matter. It also supports halfs:
Typically, during this course taught by Dr. Mark French at Purdue University, students would design a solid body electric guitar, and then build the guitar. However, I took this course when uncertainty surrounding Covid was very high, during the fall of 2020. For this reason, students still designed guitars, and then in the lab we built a stick dulcimer from scratch, and finished and assembled kit guitars.
