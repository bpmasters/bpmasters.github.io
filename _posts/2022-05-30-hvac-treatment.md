A fiber-free treatment for the attenuation of HVAC noise in an infamously noisy room in the Purdue Mechanical Engineering building.

We had class in this room for ME 613, and the HVAC noise was honestly pretty unbearable at times. For this reason, Dr. Bolton assigned us with the task of designing a fiber free treatment for this system. It was a fun project to do knowing it was something that had been bothering all (12) of the students in the course.
