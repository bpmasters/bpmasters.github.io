The design of a passive acoustic filter for a temperature humidity chamber.

This was a mathematical modeling exercise describing a method for using a series of acoustic filter elements to obtain a desired frequency specific attenuation of noise. We utilized the transfer matrix method for modelling sound transmission and reflection. This was completed for ME 613 - Advanced Engineering Acoustics, taught by Dr. Bolton at Purdue University.
