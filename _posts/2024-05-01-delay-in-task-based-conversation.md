This experiment was based upon a novel real-time processing system which manipulated the turn-taking dynamics of a conversation as it was happening. By applying a delay to the microphone of one talker, we can simulate increases in the conversational floor-transfer offset distribution which mimic the behavioral changes observed in more difficult communication environments. The goal of this work was to determine if the timing of a partner's turn-taking was used as a cue to infer whether they are experiencing difficulty.
