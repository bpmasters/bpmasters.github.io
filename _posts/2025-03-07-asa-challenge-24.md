# Challenge Problem and Approach

In this challenge, we applied spectral analysis and acoustic direction of arrival methods to characterize a pair of dolphins' motion as they swim nearby a transducer array consisting of 3 hydrophones. By utilizing frame-based energy analysis and cross-correlation based time of arrival differences, we were able to localize the dolphins over time and characterize the acoustic and temporal properties of their click emissions. A manuscript detailing our solutions is attached below. See the original problem statement [here](https://acousticstoday.org/international-student-challenge-problem-in-acoustic-signal-processing-2024-brian-g-ferguson-r-lee-culver-and-kay-l-gemba/).
