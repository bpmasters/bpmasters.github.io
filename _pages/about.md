<p>I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Waterloo, studying speech, communication, and hearing in the department of Systems Design Engineering. My research focuses on developing a better understanding of how speakers alter their speech during conversation.</p>

<p>I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Acoustical Engineering from Purdue University, which was awarded in 2022. During this time, I worked as an Acoustic Engineer Intern at both Starkey Hearing Technologies, a major global hearing aid manufacturer, and Bose Corporation, a widely recognized audio technology company. I also worked as a research assistant in the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Science, where my work focused on evaluating the performance of an open-source hearing aid.</p>
