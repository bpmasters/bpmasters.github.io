<p>I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Waterloo studying speech, communication, and hearing in the department of Systems Design Engineering. My research focuses on assessing listening effort in interactive conversation by introducing difficulty in the form of modulation of the acoustic channel. During this time, I am further developing my skills in signal processing, by developing real-time audio processing systems, and also gaining experience in the research process. I am also involved in a collaborative research project with an external group relating to using physiological metrics, such as pupil dilation, to assess listening effort in conversation.</p>

<p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Acoustical Engineering from Purdue University in 2022. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as an Acoustic Engineer Intern at both Starkey Hearing Technologies, a major global hearing aid manufacturer, and Bose Corporation, a widely recognized audio technology company. I also worked as a research assistant in the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Science with Dr. Joshua Alexander.</p>

<p>My experience is displayed in more detail in my resume below.</p>
