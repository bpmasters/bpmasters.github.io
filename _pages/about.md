<p>I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Waterloo studying speech, communication, and hearing in the department of Systems Design Engineering. My research focuses on timing of turn-taking in conversation and prediction thereof. During this time, I am further developing my skills in signal processing by developing real-time audio processing systems, and gaining experience in the research process. I am also involved in a collaborative research project with an external group relating to evaluating how some physiological and behavioral metrics change around turn-taking in conversation, and how those can be used to predict turn-taking.</p>

<p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Acoustical Engineering from Purdue University in 2022. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as an Acoustic Engineer Intern at both Starkey Hearing Technologiesand Bose Corporation. I also worked as a research assistant in the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Science's Experimental Amplification Research (EAR) Lab.</p>

<p>I'm also lucky enough to have decided to pursue work in a field in which my initials have very cool relevancy, hence the name of my site.</p>

<p>My experience is displayed in more detail in my resume below.</p>
